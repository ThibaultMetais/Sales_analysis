# Sales_analysis
A data science analysis about some sales data.

Three datasets :
* *Products*: a list of available products
* *Items*: a list of items. They are linked to order by order_id and to product by product_id.
* *Orders*: a list of customer orders on the website

**Orders and products :**
1. How many items are there in customer orders ? What is the average basket ?
2. What are the most frequent product categories ?

**Sales:**
1. How do sales evolve over time ?
2. When are mostly people buying products ? Is there any difference by product category ?
3. What are the best-sellers ? How do they weight in the sales ?
4. Predict future sales volumes.
